I want to create a professional portfolio website to showcase my work, skills, and experience. My primary source of information will be my attached resume(s). The goal is to create a dynamic and engaging online presence that expands on the information in my resume and visually demonstrates my capabilities."

I. Overall Goal & Target Audience:

Primary Goal: To [e.g., attract potential employers, secure freelance projects, showcase expertise in a specific field, network with professionals].
Target Audience: [e.g., Hiring managers in the tech industry, potential clients for design work, academic review committees, general professional network].
Key Message I Want to Convey: [e.g., I am an innovative problem-solver, a creative and detail-oriented designer, an experienced project manager, a dedicated researcher].
II. Content & Sections (to be derived and expanded from my resume):

Homepage:
Headline: A concise and compelling statement summarizing who I am and what I do (similar to a resume summary or personal statement, but more engaging for the web).
Brief Introduction: Expand slightly on the headline.
Call to Action: What do I want visitors to do? (e.g., View my work, Contact me, Download my resume).
Featured Work/Projects (Optional): Links to 2-3 key projects.
About Me Page:
Go beyond the resume's "Experience" section.
Tell my professional story: How did I get to where I am? What are my passions and motivations related to my field?
Highlight key skills and areas of expertise mentioned in the resume, perhaps with brief explanations or context.
Include a professional photo.
Portfolio/Projects/Work Section:
This is crucial. For each relevant position or project listed on my resume:
Project Title/Role.
Brief Description: What was the project? What was my role?
Challenges & Solutions: What problems did I solve? How did I approach them?
Key Responsibilities & Accomplishments: Use bullet points from my resume but expand with more detail and context. Quantify achievements where possible (e.g., "Increased user engagement by 15%").
Skills Utilized: List the specific skills (from my resume) applied to this project.
Visuals: (This is where it goes beyond the resume) Include images, videos, mockups, links to live projects, code snippets, case study PDFs, etc. Specify if you can provide these or need placeholders.
Testimonials (if applicable and available): Quotes from clients, managers, or colleagues related to the project.
Experience Page (Optional, if distinct from Projects):
If my resume has a strong chronological job history that isn't entirely project-based, this section can list roles, companies, dates, and key responsibilities/achievements, similar to the resume format but web-friendly.
Link to specific projects completed during each role where applicable.
Skills Page (Optional):
A dedicated page listing my technical skills, software proficiency, soft skills, languages, etc., from my resume.
Consider categorizing them (e.g., Programming Languages, Design Tools, Project Management).
Optionally, include proficiency levels (e.g., Advanced, Intermediate) or brief descriptions of how I've used certain skills.
Resume Page:
A clear link to download a PDF version of my latest resume.
Optionally, display the resume content directly on the page (though PDF download is standard).
Contact Page:
Contact form.
Professional email address.
Links to relevant professional social media profiles (e.g., LinkedIn, GitHub, Behance).
Optional: Phone number (consider privacy).
III. Design & Functionality:

Overall Style: [e.g., Modern, minimalist, professional, creative, corporate, clean, playful]. Provide 2-3 examples of websites you like the look and feel of, if possible.
Branding:
Do I have a logo or specific brand colors? If so, provide them.
If not, what are my color preferences?
Navigation: Clear, intuitive, and easy to use.
Responsiveness: Must be mobile-friendly and look good on all devices (desktops, tablets, phones).
Loading Speed: Optimized for fast loading.
SEO Basics: Use of keywords from my resume in page titles, descriptions, and content where appropriate.
Accessibility: Adherence to basic web accessibility standards.
IV. Information to Extract/Prioritize from My Resume(s):

Action Verbs & Accomplishments: These should be highlighted and expanded upon.
Quantifiable Results: Any numbers, percentages, or specific metrics of success.
Skills: Technical, soft, and tools/software.
Project Details: If project descriptions are brief on the resume, I will need to elaborate for the website.
Keywords: Industry-specific terms that recruiters or clients might search for.
V. What I will provide:

My resume(s) [Specify format, e.g., PDF, Word].
[If available] Professional photo.
[If available] Visuals for projects (images, videos, links).
[If available] Testimonials.
[If available] Logo and brand guidelines.
Content for the 'About Me' section (or I can draft it based on your suggestions).

VI. Questions for the Designer/Developer (or for myself):

What platform/technology do you recommend for building this site (e.g., WordPress, Squarespace, Webflow, custom code) and why?
What is the estimated timeline for completion?
What is the process for revisions and feedback?
How will I be able to update the content myself in the future?
